### Where can you get SuperMemo ?

##### Supermemo 18

You can [📥 download](https://cloud.incogito.org/s/xcc6aYmsTyYQf9Z) and use SuperMemo 18 (latest version) at no cost for the duration of the trial.

You can [🔑 purchase](https://super-memo.com/supermemo18.html) a license to remove the trial expiration at any time. In the case that you do not get your key within a few days, it is a good idea to either post on [supermemopedia](http://supermemopedia.com/wiki/Main_Page) or to email [help2020@supermemo.org](mailto:help2020@supermemo.org). 

##### SuperMemo 15

[SuperMemo 15](http://supermemopedia.com/wiki/SuperMemo_15_Freeware) is completely free to use. However, the latest version (18) comes with many additional features and usability improvements. Your experience with version 15 might differ vastly.

##### Supermemo.com

> [!NOTE] The same company publishes [supermemo.com](http://supermemo.com/), a completely different product. It is a simplified version meant for a broader public, and as such lacks many of SuperMemo 18's advanced features.

##### (Easiest) 1 on 1 tutoring

In 1-2 hours, a proficient user can teach you the basics to get you started with the essential functionalities.

Schedule a time on [picktime](https://www.picktime.com/SupermemoWiki) or, in case of issue with the first link, schedule a call [here](https://calendly.com/test0009/raj).

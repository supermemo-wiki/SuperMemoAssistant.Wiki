Future SMA releases will be published on [our GitHub page](https://github.com/supermemo/SuperMemoAssistant/releases/latest/). You may also build the software from sources.

#### Are there risks ?

!> ⚠️ **Your collection is precious**. If you are using SuperMemo, you will likely be pouring days, weeks or months of your life in building it. Don't let it all go to waste. **Make sure you have a [backup strategy](/backup-setup)**.

We have been extensively testing SMA since 2019. There are no reasons to believe your collection is at risk by using SMA. However, SMA is a very complex piece of software. A rarely occuring bug could be hiding in the code base, or a future release could have unfortunate consequences. Don't take any chances.

### Installing SMA

**Make sure you meet the pre-requisites.**

1. Open Windows Explorer (<kbd class="win"></kbd> + <kbd>E</kbd>).
2. Navigate to `%AppData%` (expands to `C:\Users\<your-user>\AppData\Roaming`).

3. Create a new folder named *SuperMemoAssistant* (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>⇧ Shift</kbd> + <kbd>N</kbd>).
